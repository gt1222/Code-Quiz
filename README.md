# Code-Quiz
This project was a challenge for me because I could not complete it and concepts just wasn't connecting. I was able to code the HTML and CSS to display the beginning part of the quiz challenge. It was tackling the javascript which I had trouble in.

I was able to write down some javascript such as the questions which would be displayed and the options. I had some part of the timer function and clickevents down but I could not figure out how to combine everything together. Separately, I understoond the concepts when it was its own portion. However, when I had to combine concepts and use them altogether in javascript, I struggled with creating variables and how I want my functions to work together. Which is why in my javascript file, none of the functions flowed together, it was all separate areas I tackled because I kind of knew what to do.


## Usage
I could only get the bones of the challenge so the html and css. Didn't have enough time and could not process how to connect the javascript.
